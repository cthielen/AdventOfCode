# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

It is offered up purely for fun. No code in this repository should be considered fit for any purpose.

Code is broken down by year, challenge day, and a `dirty` and `clean` solution. `dirty` represents what I wrote quickly, playing against the clock. `clean`, if it exists, is my opinion at a reasonable cleanup.
